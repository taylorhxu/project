The Telluride Decoding Toolbox provides a set of tools that allow users to decode brain signals into the signals that generated - whether the signals come from visual or auditory stimuli, and whether they are measured with EEG, MEG, ECoG or any other neural response for decoding. This toolbox is provided as Matlab and Python code, along with documentation and some sample EEG and MEG data. Although the developers of this toolbox are largely researchers who meet in Telluride, Colorado for a neuromorphic workshop and use EEG to analyze auditory experiments, the tools in this toolbox allow any perceptual stimulus to be connected to any neural signal.
